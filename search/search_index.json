Four colleagues take the leap into developing and growing our own company \u2013 and this will be unlike any company we\u2019ve worked at before. We have a vision for this unique venture, we have all the right talent, and we have the drive to create something innovative and new.</p> <p> </p> <p> What is The Mill Adventure? </p> <p>Founded by ex-colleagues Dario Arruda, Dominic Watson, Jo\u00e3o Dias and Robert Bowell, The Mill Adventure is a complete gaming platform, including licences and operations, for rapid deployment and success in iGaming. We\u2019re building a platform with the intent of automating and scaling as much possible, but in the most effective way possible.</p> <p>We\u2019re all veterans of the iGaming industry, and we\u2019ve all seen what works and what doesn\u2019t. We\u2019ve also been lucky enough to gather an expert team, each member with their own superpower, to help us grow and succeed with what we know is already a superior platform.</p> <p>For us, scaling is key. We\u2019re running completely in AWS (Amazon Web Services) and we don\u2019t have a single physical server. We\u2019re actually the first in the industry to do this\u2026 and we\u2019ve now made it possible for ourselves to scale to the moon, without limits.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be as successful as the biggest operators, but with a leaner team and the ability to deliver even faster.</p> <p>We\u2019re doing things a little differently from how we\u2019ve worked and what we\u2019ve seen before, and this is going to be our biggest challenge. All of the technology we\u2019re proposing to use is new \u2013 and we\u2019re also having to make our own mistakes. But these are challenges we can overcome, and we know with the right team, we can raise the bar for the industry and make a name for The Mill Adventure.</p> <p> </p> <p> What is The Mill Adventure not? </p> <p>After working in previous iGaming companies, we\u2019ve all got our pain points, and inspiration for what The Mill Adventure will not become.</p> <p>First of all, while we will grow as a team, we\u2019re going to strive to not become a huge team becoming bogged down in bureaucracy. That\u2019s the moment that innovation and efficiency stop, since the process becomes so drawn out with overheads. We created The Mill Adventure to get away from that culture, so we can confidently say that we\u2019ll be running our joint differently.</p> <p>Working as developers in previous companies, we also noticed the amount of languages and teams meant that departments couldn\u2019t share tooling or knowledge between teams like frontend and backend. So this time, we\u2019re using a single language: TypeScript.</p> <p>Maybe one of the most important things is that as a young and small company, you\u2019ll never hear the words, \u201cwell, we\u2019ve always done it this way\u201d here. Innovation and experimentation is key to our success, and we\u2019re encouraging our team to try new things as well as think of more efficient ways to do things. And part of that is also having the right team behind us: we\u2019re only hiring people we know that we need to succeed. Rather than filling roles, we\u2019re gathering right people for the job.</p> <p> </p> <p> Where does The Mill Adventure start? </p> <p>Our first project is Frank &amp; Fred, who we\u2019ll be going live with on both SGA and MGA licences. A quirky and popular brand, we couldn\u2019t be happier to kick things off with their team, and we know they\u2019ll be the first of many to join the platform.</p> <p>The thing to know about us is that we\u2019re not just another platform for run-of-the-mill white labels. We\u2019re collaborating with creators and innovators who want to shake the industry up with new concepts and features. And this is why we\u2019re so excited to begin \u2013 because even we don\u2019t know what we could dream up over time!</p> <p> </p> <p>Level 4, Pendergardens Business Centre 44, St. Andrew\u2019s Road, STJ 9023 St. Julian\u2019s, Malta</p> <p> [email\u00a0protected] </p> <ul> <li> PURPOSE </li> <li> FEATURES </li> <li> PROMISE </li> <li> TEAM </li> <li> NEWS </li> <li> CAREERS </li> <li> GET IN TOUCH </li> </ul> <p>The Mill Adventure\u2019s logo and graphic material is the company\u2019s intellectual property and may not be copied, reproduced, distributed or displayed without written consent of The Mill Adventure.
